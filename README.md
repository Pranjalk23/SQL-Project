# Pizza Sales Analysis using Advanced SQL

This repository contains SQL queries for analyzing pizza sales data, demonstrating the use of advanced SQL concepts such as window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and complex aggregations.

## Project Overview

This project aims to extract meaningful insights from pizza sales data through SQL queries. The analysis covers various aspects, including:

* Total revenue
* Average order value
* Sales trends over time
* Top-selling pizzas
* Customer behavior analysis
* Sales performance by category

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes tables for:

* `orders`: Information about pizza orders, including order ID, date, and time.
* `order_details`: Details of each order, including pizza ID and quantity.
* `pizzas`: Information about each pizza, including pizza ID, name, and size.
* `pizza_types`: Information about pizza types, including category and ingredients.

## SQL Queries

The SQL queries in this repository are organized into different sections, each focusing on a specific analysis. Key techniques demonstrated include:

* **Aggregations:** Calculating total sales, average order value, etc.
* **Window Functions:** Ranking pizzas by sales, calculating running totals, etc.
* **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.
* **Date and Time Functions:** Analyzing sales trends over time.
* **Joins:** Combining data from multiple tables.
* **Subqueries:** Performing nested queries for detailed analysis.

## Files

* `create_tables.sql`: SQL script to create the necessary tables.
* `insert_data.sql`: SQL script to insert sample data into the tables.
* `queries.sql`: SQL file containing various analytical queries.
* `results.csv`: CSV file containing the results of the queries. (Optional)
* `README.md`: This file.

## Prerequisites

* A SQL database (e.g. MySQL).
* SQL client (e.g. MySQL Workbench).
